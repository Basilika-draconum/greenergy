        "question": "How do wind turbines and solar panels work together in a renewable energy system?",
        "answer": "Wind turbines and solar panels generate electricity through different mechanisms. Wind turbines harness the kinetic energy of the wind to turn blades, which then drive a generator. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. When integrated into a renewable energy system, these technologies complement each other by providing a continuous and reliable power supply. Wind power is often more abundant during certain times, while solar power is consistent during daylight hours, resulting in a more stable overall energy output."
